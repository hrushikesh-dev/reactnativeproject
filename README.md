# React Native Custom Kotlin View

## How to Run

1. **Install dependencies:**  
   Run `npm install` (or `yarn`) in the project folder.

2. **Start Metro:**  
   Run `npm start` (or `yarn start`).

3. **Run on Android:**

## What’s Inside

- There’s a custom native view written in Kotlin that shows a triangle.
- You can set the background color from JS using the `color` prop:
  ```jsx
  <TriangleView color="#4CAF50" style={{ width: 200, height: 200 }} />
  ```

That’s it! If you have any issues, check the React Native docs or let me know.
